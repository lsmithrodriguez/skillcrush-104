			<h4>Enjoying your food!</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">			
				<p>When I first started cooking, I LOVED butter and baking desserts!  Cookies, breads, etc.</p>

				<p>Basically, I enjoying eating and cooking but wasn't healthy about it.  Side note: I also ran a lot, so I was fooled into thinking I was healthy.</p>
			</div>
				
			<h4>Eating!!!!</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">
				<p>When first starting out, it feels like there is a constant battle between watching what you eat and ENJOYING your food! </p>
				
				<p>Cooking gives you a good start, you can CHOOSE how much butter or oil or to even hide cauliflower (substitute for rice! Smart!) in your meal.</p>
			
				<p>That being said, a perfect time to spend some time thinking about your goals.  Remember - ENJOY your food!</p>
